A RESTful backend API for managing personal tasks, with secure user authentication, image upload support via AWS S3, and deployment to AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.

---

## Features

- âœ… JWT-based authentication (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/login`)
- âœ… Role-based access control (`admin`, `user`)
- âœ… Task ownership and authorization
- âœ… Image upload using S3 presigned URLs
- âœ… Serverless deployment (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)
- âœ… Clean, modular structure with TypeScript & Express

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** + **TypeScript**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose**
- **JWT** for authentication
- **AWS S3** for file storage
- **Serverless Framework** for deployment

## Auth & Authorization

- JWT-based stateless authentication.
- Tokens returned in JSON response bodies.
- Middleware checks:

  - If user is logged in
  - If user owns the task or has admin rights

---

## S3 Upload Flow

1. **Client** requests a presigned URL via `POST /files/presign`
2. **Client** uploads the file directly to S3 using the `uploadUrl`
3. **Client** submits the public file URL in the task creation or update request

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- AWS S3 bucket
- AWS IAM user with S3 permissions

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE=<your MongoDB connection string>
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=<secure_jwt_secret>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=7
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_access_key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_key>
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<your_s3_bucket>
```

### Install & Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Run Testing

```bash
npm test
```

---

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This app is deployed to **AWS Lambda** using the **Serverless Framework**:

```bash
npx serverless deploy
```

- All endpoints are routed via **API Gateway (HTTP API)**
- Environment is configured via `.env` + `serverless.yml`
- Images stored in S3 with `public-read` ACL
